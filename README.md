## React and Redux with Hot Module Replacement(HMR)

### Quick Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is boilerplate for React,Redux with HMR using Create-React-App

`create-react-app` already supports hot reloading without any additional configuration needed

I followed Mark's Dev [Blog](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2016/11/practical-redux-part-3-project-planning-and-setup/) to create Hot Module Replacement(HMR) with create-react-app.

This repo has already configured with redux with additional dependancies like `redux-thunk` `redux-promise-middleware` `redux-logger`

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/mifas/react-redux-hmr
cd react-redux-hmr
yarn install
yarn start
```
